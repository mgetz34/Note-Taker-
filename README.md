## Description

For this application, we wanted to build a note-taking application, specifically utilizing node and express.js so we can dynamically generate html content from user input real-time on the server side. This app alows the user to enter notes, then save or delete them, all encompased in a user frienldy and cleanly formatted web page. This application solves the problem of needing to take notes quickly and efficently, and the ability to save and delete these notes per the user's preference. Because the data from the user is stored in a custom formatted api, it can be readly accessed at any time. This app can be closed, reopened, and all prior notes will re-apper. This application helped to strengthen the use of vanilla js, and the fundamentals of building web applications using express.js and deploying to the third party, Heroku.
